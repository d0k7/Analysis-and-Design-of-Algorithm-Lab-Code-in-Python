        "and then sorting each bucket individually. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the function:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) The function takes an array arr as input and creates a list of empty buckets. The number of buckets is equal to the length of the input array.\n",
        "buckets = [[] for _ in range(len(arr))]\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2)The function then loops through each element in the input array and determines the index of the appropriate bucket for that element. \n",
        "It does this by multiplying the element by the length of the array, rounding down to the nearest integer, and using that as the index.\n",
        "for i in arr:\n",
        "    buckets[int(i * len(arr))].append(i)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3)After all elements have been added to their respective buckets, the function sorts each bucket using the built-in sorted function.\n",
        "return [j for i in buckets for j in sorted(i)]\n",
        "\n",
        "4)Finally, the function concatenates all the sorted buckets into a single list and returns it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the bucket sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n+k), where n is the number of elements in the input array and k is the number of buckets. \n",
        "The algorithm can be particularly efficient when the input elements are uniformly distributed over a range, as the buckets can be roughly the same size \n",
        "and sorting each bucket can be done relatively quickly.\n",
